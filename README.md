## Tools

**Communication:** Discord  
**IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA with Code with Me Plugin  
**Language:** JAVA  
**Compiler:** Maven  
**Unit Testing:** JUnit  
**Code Coverage Tool:** JaCoCo

**Rationale:**  
Before deciding on our toolset, we met to discuss the group's familiarity with the tools needed to complete the project.
Most of our group members are familiar with JAVA (or a JAVA-like language like C#), so we
decided to use JAVA for our project.

The source code for the project features a pre-made unit test example using JUnit 5, so we continued to use JUnit
for the remainder of our unit tests. As for the IDE, one of our group members had the premium version of IntelliJ, which
allowed for us to mob with our full group (community version only allows for 3 members). Maven was chosen just due to
familiarity with the compiler. We chose JaCoCo for our code coverage tool after reviewing the links provided from our
professor. None of us have used code coverage tools for JAVA before, and JaCoCo had a lot of good tutorials for us to
follow.

Discord was chosen as our form of communication due to group member preference and professor recommendation. Many of us
are already familiar with the communication tool.
